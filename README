What's Manitou-Mail
===================

Manitou is a database-driven mail user-agent and associated utilities.
It provides a framework and tools for storing and exposing mail as
organized data, accessible by SQL. It is aimed at handling seamlessly
large mailboxes, possibly processed by multiple concurrent users.  In
addition to the features commonly found in traditional mail programs,
its user interface comes with some more unique, database oriented ways
to organize, process and retrieve mail messages.

Build notes
===========
In order to build from sources pulled from the version control repository,
the configure script and Makefile.in files need to be generated by the
autotools. Use `autoreconf -i` to remake them, or
`aclocal && autoheader && autoconf && automake -a -c`.

After configure, GNU make must be used (Makefiles use '%'-style pattern rules).
