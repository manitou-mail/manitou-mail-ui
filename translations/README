Translation files for Manitou-Mail user interface.

This directory contains *.ts text files for manitou Qt user's interface.
Each of these files are named manitou_xx.ts where xx is the code
of the language (ex: manitou_fr.ts for french).

At launch time, manitou gets the language from its environment
(typically through the LANG variable), then searches for a compiled
version of a translation files, named manitou_xx.qm and uses it
if available. The files should have been installed under
the $datadir/manitou/translations directory, where $datadir
defaults to $prefix/share and $prefix defaults to /usr/local.

The ts files are maintained using Qt 'linguist' application.
See http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtlinguist-index.html for a complete
documentation.
Compilation of translation files is done by the 'lrelease' Qt utility.

Both 'linguist' and 'lrelease' are part of Qt.

When using a pre-compiled libqt package set up by a third party, these
tools may be available separately from the library; for example
they're in the qttools5-dev-tools in Debian/Ubuntu distributions.
